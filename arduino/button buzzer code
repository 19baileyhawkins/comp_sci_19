BUZZER

  Use the buzzer to play a song!

  The buzzer in your Inventor's Kit is an electromechanical
  component you can use to make noise. Inside the buzzer is a
  coil of wire and a small magnet. When current flows through 
  the coil, it becomes magnetized and pulls towards the magnet,
  creating a tiny "click". When you do this thousands of times
  per second, you create tones.

  The Arduino has a built-in command called tone() which clicks
  the buzzer at a certain frequency. This sketch knows the
  frequencies of the common notes, allowing you to create songs.
  We're never going to let you down!

Hardware connections:

  The buzzer has two pins. One is positive and one is negative.
  The postitive pin is marked by a "+" symbol on both the top
  and bottom of the buzzer.

  Connect the positive pin to Arduino digital pin 9.
  (Note that this must be a PWM pin.)
  Connect the negative pin to GND.

  Tip: if the buzzer doesn't fit into the breadboard easily,
  try rotating it slightly to fit into diagonal holes.

with lots of help from the Arduino community.

This sketch uses the buzzer to play songs.
The Arduino's tone() command will play notes of a given frequency.
We'll provide a function that takes in note characters (a-g),
and returns the corresponding frequency from this table:

  note  frequency
  c     262 Hz
  d     294 Hz
  e     330 Hz
  f     349 Hz
  g     392 Hz
  a     440 Hz
  b     494 Hz
  C     523 Hz
